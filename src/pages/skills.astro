  <IconText icon="typescript">
    TypeScript is awesome. I love it. I use it for everything that fits since
    the beginning of 2014. The tooling, the ecosystem, the community and the
    philosophy is what I like the most.

  <IconText icon="nodejs">
    The good old nodejs. It has it's flaws and quirks, but it's still the best
    right now IMHO. It's stable, fast and has a great ecosystem. If you know how
    to use it, it's a great tool to get things done on the web. Combine it with
    dotenv, nvm and other awesome tools and you got yourself a comfy
    environment.

  <IconText icon="react">
    My go-to frontend libary. I just like that it is not a framework which makes
    it very flexible. The community and the tooling around it are also big
    pluses. I gathered some experience around Vue and Svelte and am currently
    checking out solid.js to find a successor to react. For static page
    generation I really like astro. Static pages are still cool ;) Next.js is
    also my preferred extension to react in many cases.

  <IconText icon="docker">
    I will never go back to a world without docker and containers. I can only
    imagine a future without docker where it was replaced by something even
    better. If it runs in docker it runs everywhere. I love it. Pair it with
    docker compose and automate your whole dev environment with a single
    command.
  </IconText>
  <IconText icon="githubactions">
    Git. I've never used anything else. So i guess it's the best :P. GitHub,
    GitLab, etc... Irreplacable for a good gitOps workflow. Combined with a
    CI/CD like GitHub Actions or GitLabCI, sprinkle in some ansible or similar,
    setup sane rules for your repo and get rid of most human tasks which could
    result in mistakes. Because, you know, we are still humans.
