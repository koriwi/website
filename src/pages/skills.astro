  <IconText icon="typescript">
    TypeScript is awesome. I love it. I use it for everything that fits. The
    tooling, the ecosystem, the community and the philosophy is what I like the
    most.

  <IconText icon="nodejs">
    The good old nodejs. It has it's flaws and quirks, but it's still the best
    right now IMHO. It's stable, fast and has a great ecosystem. If you know how
    to use it, it's a great tool to get things done on the web.

  <IconText icon="react">
    My go-to frontend libary. I just like that it is not a framework which makes
    it very flexible. The community and the tooling around are also a big plus.
    I could gather some experienc around Vue and Svelte and am currently
    checking out solid.js to find a successor to react. For static page
    generation I really like astro. Static pages are still cool ;) Next.js is
    also my preferred extension to react in many cases.
